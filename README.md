//hello world!

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. The values R, G, and B, usually evaluate to decimal values, making floats the most legible option for the computer.
2. _bounce is counting the amount of times the ball touches another surface, making it a whole number integer each time.
3. The presence of the semicolon indicates a line end which is critical for the computer to interpret individual lines of code (syntax error). 

### W3
Table 18
Void setLightDimness(float x){
		Float lightLevel = 100 * x;
}

1. The relationship between classes and components is like a russian nesting doll. Inside the game is the scene, inside the scene is the components, inside the components is the scripts, and finally, inside the scripts is the classes. Creating and altering classes within a script that is assigned to a component creates new attributes within the inspector (after serializing) that can be altered affecting gameplay. Such attributes include object velocity and color as seen in this activity. Understanding this nesting doll relationship allows a programmer to alter gameplay efficiently.

2. There is no if statement preventing the brightness attribute from becoming too high, so as the ball increases in speed, it bounces more often, leading to increasingly consistent increases in brightness.
